# Re-ducks Typescript Todos Example

This project is a practical sample that replaces [Redux todo app example](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todos) with typescript and Re-ducks pattern, and adds router, typesafe-actions, etc.

The structure of the state etc. is referring to [this awesome Re-ducks project](https://github.com/jthegedus/re-ducks-examples/tree/master/re-ducks-todos).

It is created based on [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
